1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered,and why?
A: I think Vue.js(#16) is most polish and delivered. Since I have known nothing about Vue.js before I watched presentation. Besides Angular and React, there are many great framework to build our front-end. I even want to try this tool after class.

2. Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?
A: Web Assembly(#24) is very interesting and I have learnt a lot from that. 
Before this introduction, I have known about something about web assembly but not
very profound. The presentation gave me the instructorâ€™s insights about web assembly.
And make me have more interests on this cool project.

3. Which talk did you like the best and why?
A: I like Redis and Memcached(#19) best because it gave me a comparison about two
different and popular tools which are used for store session in scale. The presentation was fluent and full of passion.
